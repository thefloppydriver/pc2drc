Short Term
----------
-target 854x480 vnc geometry to fit gamepad screen & pad last 10 pixels
-clean up and c++ify program
-document how to reduce drc-x264 quality to gain FPS on slower PCs

Wishlist
--------
-allow vnc to use any resolution screen (scaling)
-link to libdrc statically instead of dynamically like the demos do, 
  so we don't need to do the LD_LIBRARY_PATH thing
