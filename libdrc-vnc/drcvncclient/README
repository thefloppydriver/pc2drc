Readme:
DRC VNC Client - VNC client for the Wii U Gamepad using libdrc

Pre-requisites
--------------
libdrc - kordariffic\input-mods fork, available from
         https://bitbucket.org/kordariffic/libdrc/branch/input-mods
libSDL2
libvncclient (usually distributed with libvncserver)

Building
--------
1. libdrc kordariffic\input-mods fork

This requires the kordariffic\input-mods fork of libdrc, available from
 https://bitbucket.org/kordariffic/libdrc/branch/input-mods
This fork improves upon libdrc's analog and button code.

Clone it, build it and install it to wherever you install custom stuff

Example (using a custom prefix for libdrc installation)

$ cd /your_working_dir
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/kordariffic/libdrc/branch/input-mods
$ cd input-mods

Then build libdrc as per the instructions at
http://libdrc.org/docs/installation.html#building-libdrc
I recommend you use a custom prefix in your configure command
i.e. --prefix=/home/username/local
so you don't trash your regular libdrc install and can have multiple 
libdrc forks available to use.
Otherwise it'll install to the default prefix, usually /usr/local which 
does make things easier.

$ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PATCHED_X264_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH ./configure --prefix=/customprefix
$ make
$ make install

2. drcvncclient

$ cd /your_working_dir
$ git clone https://github.com/duanemach/drcvncclient.git
$ cd drcvncclient

If you used a customprefix to install libdrc you need to use the 
PKG_CONFIG_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH expressions as below

$ ./autogen.sh
$ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/customprefix/usr/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH ./configure
$ make
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/customprefix/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./src/drcvncclient :1

Or if you installed libdrc to somewhere in your system's existing search paths

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ ./src/drcvncclient :1

Preparation
-----------
1. The vnc server must have dimensions 854x480, otherwise we segfault.
i.e. start vncserver with the geometry command as below

$ vncserver :1 -geometry 854x480

2. The Wii U Gamepad must be ready for PC control.
a. It is paired with the hostapd running on your PC, and
b. It has received an IP address from a DHCP server running on your PC
If the gamepad can run the libdrc demo programs, it's ready.

Usage
-----
drcvncclient [-joystick] [host]:display

Command Line Options:

-joystick
  Enables the system input feeder, which forwards button & joystick presses
  to the PC as uinput events. Useful for gaming.
  With this option, use the gamepad TV button to toggle between joystick
  and mouse modes.

Control
-------
Without the -joystick command line option the gamepad is locked in mouse mode.
Touch the screen to move the mouse.
Left click with ZL or ZR.
Right click with L or R.

With the -joystick command line option, the gamepad starts in joystick mode.
The system input feeder sends all button and axis events to the system 
as a gamepad device, like a regular game controller.
Press the TV button briefly to toggle between joystick and mouse mode.
In mouse mode the system input feeder is still active but feeding
idle/zero axis and button data to the system.
