Documentation
=============

libdrc is a library for application developers who want to use the capabilities
of the Wii U GamePad in their software. It also provides the ability to
simulate a Wii U GamePad to communicate with a Wii U.

It currently runs only on Linux and relies on C++11. A very small C wrapper to
the library is available in order for non-C++11 programs to use the basic
features of libdrc.
